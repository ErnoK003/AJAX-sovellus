Copilot was very helpful when commenting code.

## About The App
`Movie planner` is an app that lets you search for available showings of movies in Finnkino theaters by making use of XML data Finnkino provides on their website. The app includes all Finnkino theaters that Finnkino has listed. You can order the results either by time(default) or by name.
